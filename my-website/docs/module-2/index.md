# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook! This module focuses on creating digital twins of your humanoid robot using physics simulation environments. You'll learn to build virtual worlds where your robot can be tested, trained, and validated before deployment on physical hardware.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. Install and configure Gazebo simulation environment for physics-based robot simulation
2. Import your Module 1 URDF robot model into Gazebo and configure it for simulation
3. Simulate various sensors (LiDAR, Depth Camera, IMU) on your robot model
4. Understand physics simulation concepts including gravity, collisions, and material properties
5. Integrate Gazebo with Unity for high-fidelity visualization and human-robot interaction
6. Develop perception and control algorithms using simulated sensor data

## Module Overview

This module is divided into four main sections that progressively build your understanding of digital twin technology:

- **Gazebo Fundamentals**: Learn the basics of physics simulation, including setting up environments, configuring physics properties, and understanding how gravity and collisions work in virtual worlds.

- **URDF and SDF in Simulation**: Discover how to convert your URDF robot model from Module 1 to SDF format for Gazebo, and configure it properly for simulation.

- **Sensor Simulation**: Explore how to simulate various sensors on your robot, including LiDAR for navigation, depth cameras for perception, and IMUs for orientation sensing.

- **Integration with Unity**: Learn to connect Gazebo physics simulation with Unity's high-fidelity rendering engine for realistic visualization and human-robot interaction.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Completed Module 1 (The Robotic Nervous System - ROS 2)
- Your humanoid robot URDF model from Module 1
- Basic understanding of ROS 2 concepts (nodes, topics, services)
- Ubuntu Linux environment with ROS 2 installed

## Getting Started

Begin with the [Gazebo Fundamentals](./gazebo-fundamentals.md) section to learn about setting up your first simulation environment. This foundation will prepare you for the more advanced topics in subsequent sections.
