# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, students will be able to:

1. Install and configure NVIDIA Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation
2. Implement hardware-accelerated Visual SLAM (VSLAM) using the Isaac ROS stack on NVIDIA Jetson hardware
3. Configure the Nav2 framework specifically for bipedal humanoid movement, accounting for unique kinematic constraints
4. Understand and apply sim-to-real transfer methodologies to bridge the gap between simulation and real-world deployment

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, students should have:

- A working understanding of ROS 2 concepts from Module 1
- Experience with Gazebo and Unity simulations from Module 2
- Basic knowledge of robot kinematics and URDF models
- Access to NVIDIA GPU hardware for Isaac Sim (recommended: RTX series)

## Module Overview

This module focuses on Advanced Perception and Training using NVIDIA's Isaac ecosystem. We'll explore how to leverage Isaac Sim for creating realistic training data, implement hardware-accelerated perception pipelines using Isaac ROS, configure navigation for complex bipedal robots, and understand the challenges and methodologies of transferring models from simulation to the real world.

## Topics Covered

1. **Isaac Sim Fundamentals**: Introduction to the Omniverse platform, photorealistic simulation, and synthetic data generation
2. **Isaac ROS & Hardware Acceleration**: Detailed exploration of the Isaac ROS stack, focusing on hardware-accelerated VSLAM pipelines
3. **Path Planning with Nav2**: Deep dive into Nav2 framework components and configuration for bipedal humanoid movement
4. **Sim-to-Real Transfer**: Defining challenges and methodologies for transferring models trained in Isaac Sim to real-world deployment
