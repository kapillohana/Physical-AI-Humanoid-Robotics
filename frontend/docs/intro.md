# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

## Welcome to the Future of Robotics

This comprehensive textbook covers the cutting-edge field of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. Through a systematic approach, we'll explore the theoretical foundations and practical implementations that drive the next generation of intelligent robotic systems.

## Course Structure

This textbook is organized into four comprehensive modules:

- **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Understanding the communication backbone of robotic systems
- **Module 2: Simulation Environments (Gazebo)** - Creating virtual worlds for robot testing and development
- **Module 3: Advanced Simulation (Isaac Sim)** - NVIDIA's powerful simulation platform
- **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action Models** - Integrating perception, reasoning, and action

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will:
- Master the ROS 2 framework for robotic communication and control
- Develop simulation environments for robot testing
- Understand advanced simulation techniques with Isaac Sim
- Integrate vision, language, and action models for intelligent robotics
- Build complete robotic systems with AI capabilities

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge (Python preferred)
- Understanding of linear algebra and calculus
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Basic electronics and robotics concepts
