# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Welcome to the capstone module of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This module covers the convergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Robotics, focusing on Cognitive Planning and Conversational Robotics.

In this module, you will learn about:
- Speech recognition pipelines using OpenAI Whisper
- LLM-based cognitive planning for robotics
- Complete integration of voice commands to robotic actions
- Ethical considerations in conversational robotics

This is the culmination of all previous modules, bringing together ROS 2, simulation, and AI planning into a unified system.
