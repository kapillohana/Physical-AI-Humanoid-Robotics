## Prompt

Based on the fully implemented "Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)" content you generated and deployed, generate the retrospective plan that details the file structure and key content sections you created. I need this to document the project process.

## Response

Generated comprehensive retrospective plan documenting the implementation of "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" textbook foundation, including:
- Complete file structure documentation
- Detailed content breakdown for Module 1
- Technical architecture and configuration details
- Implementation process and success metrics
- Future considerations and expansion plans

## Outcome

Successfully created plan.md with complete retrospective documentation of the Module 1 implementation, including all file structures, content sections, and technical decisions made during the implementation process.

## Evaluation

The plan document provides comprehensive coverage of the implemented textbook foundation, detailing the architecture, content structure, and implementation decisions that support the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics educational objectives.
