The Module 2 content must be generated and placed inside a new directory at **docs/module-2/** in the Docusaurus project. The focus is on **Physics Simulation and Environment Building**. The specification must cover the creation of Docusaurus documentation content for the following topics, broken into separate markdown files: 1. **Gazebo Fundamentals:** Setup, Simulating physics, gravity, and collisions. 2. **URDF and SDF in Simulation:** Loading the humanoid model (from Module 1 URDF) into Gazebo. 3. **Sensor Simulation:** Simulating and visualizing sensor data for LiDAR, Depth Cameras (RealSense), and IMUs. 4. **Integration with Unity:** High-fidelity rendering and setting up for human-robot interaction using the Unity ecosystem (e.g., Unity Robotics Hub or ROS-Unity bridge). Additionally, the agent must: * Define the learning outcomes for Module 2. * **Update the sidebars.ts file** to include a new navigation group for Module 2 with links to the generated files. * The final output should be the **spec document**, followed by the **implementation of the new module files** in the correct directory.\")"
